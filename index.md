I'm a data scientist and [banjo player](https://twitter.com/rrherr/status/1072128383428059136) from Normal, Illinois. Ever since I first programmed LOGO turtles on an Apple IIe, I've loved mixing code, math, and art in interactive environments.

I teach at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). I'm interested in how software can give creative feedback to help learners practice new skills.

[Here's the Predictive Modeling Portfolio Project](https://lambdaschool.github.io/ds/unit2/portfolio-project/ds6) that I recently added to the curriculum.
