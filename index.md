# Ryan Herr

Ryan aspires to be a Banjo Data Scientist: better at banjo than statisticians and software engineers, and better at stats and software than banjo players. He believes the way to be at the top of your field is to [choose a very small field](https://www.ted.com/talks/simone_giertz_why_you_should_make_useless_things/transcript).  His favorite software methodology is JDD ([Joke-Driven Development](https://blog.ncase.me/questions-from-eyeo/)). Ever since he first programmed LOGO turtles on an Apple IIe, heâ€™s loved mixing code, math, and art in interactive environments.
